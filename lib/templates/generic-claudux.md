# {{PROJECT_NAME}} - Coding Patterns & Conventions (Generic)

- Capture real patterns from the codebase: architecture, testing, error handling, performance, and utilities.
- Framework-agnostic; avoid platform-specific guidance unless relevant to the detected project type.
- Prefer small, composable modules, clear naming, and explicit error handling.

Sections to produce after analysis:
- Architecture overview and directory layout
- Data flow and state management
- Error handling and logging
- Testing strategy (unit/integration/e2e)
- Performance guidelines
- Security considerations
- Common utilities and helpers

This is a reference skeleton; generated `CLAUDE.md` must mirror actual repository patterns.
